	lighting_alpha = LIGHTING_PLANE_ALPHA_NV_TRAIT - 5	//This acts as *slightly* more powerful nightvision compared to the nightvision trait, if someone chooses NV as a trait it will be overwritten by this (highest wins).
	//This reason these eyes do not inherit from /night_vision/ is because the fullbright the night_vision subtype provides is too overpowered for a roundstart selectable race.
